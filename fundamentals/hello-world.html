    <!-- The script tag 
         JavaScript programs can be inserted almost anywhere
         into an HTML document using the <script> tag -->
    <script>
        alert(' Hello, world!')
    </script>

    <!-- Try on the browser, open the file and see what happens -->
</body>
</html>

<!-- The <script> tag has a few attributes that are rarely used nowadays but
     can still be found in old code: 
     
     The type attribute: <script type = ""> It's an old standard required on HTML4 but 
     it's not required anymore. Also the modern HTML standart totally changed the meaning of this
     attribute (Andvanced  topic on JavaScript Modules).

     The language attribute: <script language = ""> This attribute was meant to show the language
     of the script but actually is not usefull because the default language is JavaScript.
    -->
    
<!-- External scripts -->
<!-- If we have a lot of JavaScript code, we can put it into a separate file 
     Script files are attached to HTML with the src attribute: 
     <script src = "/fundamentals/example.js"></script>
     The Path is an absolute path to the site root. One can also provide a relative path from the current page.
     for instance, src = "script.js" would mean in the current folder.

     We can give a full URL as well.
     <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.11/lodash.js"></script>
    -->

<!-- Recomendations -->
<!--    - Emmbed javascript into an html is not a good practice for projects
          but you have to know that exist.
        - A single <script> tag can't have both the src attribute and code inside.
        - As a rule, only the simplest scripts are put into HTML. More complex ones reside
          in separate files.
        - Always put the script tag after the body tag. (This will secure that your javascript runs after your existing HTML)
