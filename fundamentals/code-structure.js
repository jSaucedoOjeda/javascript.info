/**
 * Statements

 * Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions
 * Statements can be separated with a semicolon.

    //This is a statement and we can have as many statements in our code as we want.
    alert('Hello');

    //Usuarlly, statements are written on separate lines to make the code more readable:
    alert('Hello');
    alert('World')

    
    //Semicolon can be omitted when a line break exists. 
    //Javascript interprets the linea break as an implicit semicolon.
    

    //There are cases when a newline does not mean a semicolon. For example:
    alert(3 +
        1
        + 2);

    //This happens because it's a incomplete expression. 
    //We recommend putting semicolons between statements even if they are separated by newlines.
